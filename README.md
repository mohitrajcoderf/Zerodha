# Zerodha
A Zerodha landing page features a logo, navigation links, and a prominent CTA button in the header. The hero section has a bold headline, subheadline, and main CTA, often with a background image. Key features are displayed in a grid with icons and brief descriptions. Testimonials and a footer with links and contact info complete the design.
